## Description

Explore the basics of web development in this AirBnB Clone Front-End Project, focusing on HTML and CSS fundamentals without JavaScript, and crafted as part of [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.fr/) software development program.

# Background Context
## Web static, what?
Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it‚Äôs time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to ‚Äúdesign‚Äù / ‚Äúsketch‚Äù / ‚Äúprototype‚Äù each element:

* Create simple HTML static pages
* Style guide
* Fake contents
* No Javascript
* No data loaded from anything
During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. I really encourage you to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you can‚Äôt apply any design.

Before starting, please fork or clone the repository `AirBnB_clone` from your partner if you were not the owner of the previous project.
